-- This program tries to show all possible GuidedTrack keywords and operators
-- so that you can determine whether the syntax highlighting plugin is working
-- correctly. Note that this is almost certainly *not* a valid GT program; its
-- only purpose is to showcase the syntax, not to provide correct examples of
-- how to use the API. If you notice that any items are missing from this
-- program, please let the maintainers know!
